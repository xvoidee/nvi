# Throubleshooting
This section comes before first steps as most probably you will run into minor issues.

#### It is stuck during install with various wget-like output.
Sometimes it happens at the end, kill it, install complete

#### "client coc abnormal exit with: 1" after startup in status line
Intellisense plugin coc was not installed, build it from source:
:call coc#util#build()

#### I cannot quit from nvimclipse with F10 key!
Disable menu (F10) accelerator key in preferences for your gnome-terminal

#### Weird characters are displayed everywhere
NerdFont is not setFont selection in Ubuntu 18.04 changed, you need to set it up in a following way:
```
sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool
gnome-tweaks
```
Select section "Font" on left pane and then select your monospace font on the right side.

#### Bold fonts are messing color experience
Disable bold fonts in your terminal. If not possible (under Ubuntu 18.04), use another terminal, like terminator
